# Every.io Code Challenge

https://www.loom.com/share/3df7fcb5424644638b00724cb178e2ff

## Getting Started with the Every.io engineering challenge.

Thanks for taking the time to complete the Every.io code challenge. Don't worry, it's not too hard, and please do not spend more than an hour or two. We know you have lots of these to do, and it can be very time consuming. If you feel like adding fancy animations, or getting all hip and fresh with the design, go ahead, but it won't earn you any extra points.

The biggest factor will be your code:

- How readable is your code.
- How did you organize your components.
- Are there any bugs.

## Before you start

Feel free to fork this repo. If you want to keep things private, that's understandable and we are totally okay with that. Once you finish send an invite to these users:

## Requirements

See the [prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/kd49ArXbBt0vi1kBSLkmC1/Code-Challenge?node-id=1%3A2&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=0%3A1) for an example.

You will be creating a basic todo list, with the following requirements.

### The list has 3 columns. Similar to Trello.

- Todo
- In Progress
- Done

### Each list item has a right and left arrow button.

The right arrow moves the list item to the next column:

- Todo to In Progress
- In Progress to Done

The Left arrow moves the list item to the previous column:

- Done to In Progress
- In Progress to Todo

### Button States

- If the list item is in the first column, the left button should be **disabled**
- If the list item is in the last column, the right button should be **disabled**

### Adding New Items

There should be a form with a text input below the columns. When the user submits the form, the text from the text input should be added to a new todo item in the first column.
